# Description
In this project, I re-implement a few container types of the C++ standard template library. comply with the C++98 standard, so any later feature of the containers MUST NOT be implemented, 

# Containers
Recoding from scratch the following containers with their Methods that exist in std--98

- Vector
- Stack : using vector class as default underlying container. But it must still be compatible with other containers, the STL ones included.
- Map : RedBlack Tree Implementation  
- Set : RedBlack Tree Implementation  

You also have to implement:
- iterators_traits
- reverse_iterator
- enable_if
- is_integral
- equal and/or lexicographical_compare
- std::pair
- std::make_pair

- See Subject attached for more details about the projects requirments
